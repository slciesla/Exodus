Pixel This Change Log

10/24/14 - v1.2.1
Fixed an issue with most subreddits not working. The issue seemed to be rooted in the fact that not all subreddits
support sorting by "top", but all that I've tested seem to support sorting by time, so I switched to that.

10/24/14 - v1.2.0
Bombs got a huge boost and as a result had the reload time boost granted by an upgrade quartered
Added a prompt on a new session about the party pixel flashing, option is still in the menu
Added new upgrades for party pixel
Popping a party pixel now gives bonus pixels, purely based on your bank with no cap
Added a search term box which lets you specify either search terms or a subreddit
- Subreddits must be in the form of /r/subreddit
- Search terms can follow the q value rules at https://api.imgur.com/endpoints/gallery#gallery-search
- So you can put "kitties ext: gif" in the search box (without the quotes) and get only kitty gifs. :-)
- I have not had good luck using the boolean operators, but they should work in theory (e.g. "kitties OR puppies ext: gif")
- If you have exhausted 10 pages of results (600 images) based on the filters, it will drop you back to random gallery
- For example, if you go to a certain subreddit where girls are wild, without NSFW toggled, there is a very high chance you'll just wind up back in random
Added a NSFW Toggle box. If this is toggled, it means NSFW images are allowed. It DOES NOT mean only NSFW images will show up
